METADATA:-

The dataset comprises images acquired from a large portion of the MRL eye dataset. 
This dataset is classified on , basically four measures : -

1.	Closed eyes :-
         With closed eyes , the chances of being drowsy is more .

PROJECT OBJECTIVES : -


1.	The purpose of the drowsiness detection system is to aid in the prevention of accidents passenger and commercial vehicles.

2.	We will apply different models to check the accuracy of the project.

3.	To alert the driver on the detection of drowsiness.(possibly will try to give a bell sound at the time recognition).

4.	Advantage of the this project â€“ 

4.1.	Speed of the vehicle can be reduced.
